>.What kind of data can FS, Streams, Buffers handle? 
  All 3 can handle any file type: 
     //.txt, .json, .csv — text 
    //.pdf, .jpg, .mp4, .mp3 — binary 
    // .zip, .exe, .iso — anything 
      They do not care about format — just deal with bytes.

>>Can we use Stream without Buffer? 

>>When should we prefer Streams over FS or Buffers? 
Use Case                           Use 
✅ Small files                  fs.readFile() 
✅ Large files (logs/videos)     Streams 
✅ Realtime piping               Streams 
✅ Memory efficiency             Streams + Buffers
✅ Need control over bytes       Buffers

>>How does Buffer work with Streams? 
In Streams: 
1. Data arrives chunk-by-chunk 
2. Each chunk is stored in a Buffer object 
3. You read/write/modify that Buffer 
4. Then it’s cleared for the next chunk
