// streams : Streams are the objects that facilitate you to read data from a source and write data to a destination. There are four types of streams in Node.js:

Readable: This stream is used for read operations.
Writable: This stream is used for write operations.
Duplex: This stream can be used for both read and write operations.
Transform: It is type of duplex stream where the output is computed according to input.

Each type of stream is an Event emitter instance and throws several events at different times. Following are some commonly used events:

Data:This event is fired when there is data available to read.
End:This event is fired when there is no more data available to read.
Error: This event is fired when there is any error receiving or writing data.
Finish:This event is fired when all data has been flushed to underlying system.
