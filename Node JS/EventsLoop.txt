Event Loop is a core part of the Node.js runtime that enables asynchronous, non-blocking operations.
 //It is responsible for handling all asynchronous operations in Node.js and allows the execution of JavaScript code, performing I/O operations, and managing concurrency without creating multiple threads.

How does it works ?
 //Node.js operates on a single-threaded event-driven architecture. This means that although Node.js uses a single thread to execute JavaScript code, 
   //it can still handle multiple I/O operations simultaneously through its event-driven, non-blocking architecture. The event loop is at the heart of this.

>Call Stack: The event loop interacts with the call stack, where synchronous code (regular JavaScript) gets executed. 
              //When a function is invoked, it is pushed onto the stack, and when it completes, it is popped off the stack.

>Callback Queue (Task Queue): When an asynchronous operation like a file system read, database query, or network request completes,
                              // its associated callback function is added to the callback queue.

>Event Loop: The event loop continuously checks the call stack to see if it is empty.
            // If the stack is empty, the event loop picks the first callback from the callback queue and pushes it onto the stack for execution.
              // If the call stack is not empty, the event loop waits until the current operations complete.

>Phases of the Event Loop: The event loop is divided into different phases, each with a specific purpose. 
                   //Each phase has a callback queue associated with it, and the event loop processes the callbacks in these queues in order.
                    // like -Timers Phase(setTimeout() and setInterval()),
                            Pending Callbacks(deferred I/O callbacks like TCP errors)
                            Idle/Prepare(Internal use by libuv.)
                            Poll Phase(File reads)
                            Check Phase(setImmediate())
                             Close Callbacks(Executes close events(socket.on('close')))

>Microtask Queue: Thereâ€™s also a micro task queue, which holds promises and other micro tasks like process.nextTick(). 
          //Micro tasks are processed immediately after the currently executing task completes, but before the event loop moves on to the next phase.

Real time example - For asynchronous operations
  --JS calls fs.readFile()
  --Node offloads this to libuv(Libuv has are 4 threads by default).
     // adjust the size of the libuv thread pool by setting the "UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE" environment variable. The maximum value is 1024.
     //libuv uses its thread pool and Reads file
     //Event Loop: Pushes the callback into the callback queue
     //Executes callback when control reaches that phase
  --- For synchronous operations:
     //synchronous or CPU-intensive code (like loops, compression, encryption, image processing) blocks the event loop, preventing it from handling other requests.
     //Worker Threads allow us to offload synchronous code to a separate JavaScript thread (not libuv's C++ thread pool), so the main thread stays free.
     // Each Worker has its own V8 instance and event loop, so it does not block the main thread.
     //There is no hard-coded limit in Node.js itself for how many Worker Threads you can create but 4-8 is ideal.
 

Key Features of the Event Loop:
>Single-threaded: Node.js uses a single thread for JavaScript execution, but the event loop enables it to handle multiple concurrent operations.
>Non-blocking I/O: Time-consuming tasks (like reading a file or making network requests) are delegated to the event loop, freeing the main thread to handle other tasks.
>Phases: The event loop operates in different phases, handling timers, I/O, and other callbacks in an orderly manner.
>Microtask Queue: Microtasks (like promises and process.nextTick) have higher priority and are executed right after the current operation completes but before moving to the next event loop phase.
