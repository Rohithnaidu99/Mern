/*
Middleware :

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next
middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. 
These functions are used to modify req and res objects for tasks like parsing request bodies,
adding response headers, etc.

The next() function in the express is responsible for calling the next middleware function if there is one.

Advantages of using middleware:

Middleware can process request objects multiple times before the server works for that request.
Middleware can be used to add logging and authentication functionality.
Middleware improves client-side rendering performance.
Middleware is used for setting some specific HTTP headers.
Middleware helps for Optimization and better performance.

Middleware Syntax: The basic syntax for the middleware functions are as follows –

app.get(path, (req, res, next) => {}, (req, res) => {})

The middle part (req,res,next)=>{} is the middleware function. 
Here we generally perform the actions required before the user is allowed to view the webpage 
or call the data and many other functions. 
So let us create our own middleware and see its uses.

If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

An Express application can use the following types of middleware:

Application-level middleware
Router-level middleware
Error-handling middleware
Built-in middleware
Third-party middleware
