In Express.js, both `res.send()` and `res.end()` are used to send a response to the client, but there are some differences:
1. ** res.send()`**
**Usage:** It is a higher-level method that simplifies sending various types of responses.
- **Functionality:** It automatically sets the Content-Type` header based on the type of the response (e.g., JSON, HTML, text).
**Example: **
javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
res.send('Hello, World!');
});
**Note:** It is versatile and can handle strings, objects, arrays, and other response types. It's a good choice for most scenarios.
2. ** res.end()`**
**Usage: ** It is a lower-level method that sends a response with raw data.
     **Functionality:** You need to manually set the Content-Type` header and handle the data to be sent.
**Example:**
javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
res.end('Hello, World!');
});
**Note:** It's useful when you need more control over the response, but it requires more manual handling.
In summary, res.send()` is often preferred for its simplicity and automatic content-type handling, while `res.end()` provides more control over the response 
    //but requires additional manual configuration. The choice depends on the specific requirements of your application.
