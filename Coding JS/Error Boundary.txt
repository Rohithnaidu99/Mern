Error Boundary Vs try & catch block :

Error Boundary-error boundary is a React component that catches JavaScript errors anywhere in its child component tree, logs those errors, and displays a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire React application.
// Error boundaries are designed to gracefully handle errors that occur during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the components they wrap.
componentDidCatch method used for life cycle method.

//<ErrorBoundary>
  <MyComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>


Note -It's important to note that error boundaries only catch errors that occur during rendering.
// They do not catch errors that occur in event handlers (e.g., onClick) or in asynchronous code (e.g., setTimeout or a fetch request) within the component tree.

Try and Catch Blocks --

the try and catch blocks are used for error handling. 
 //They allow you to attempt to execute code that might throw an error, and if an error occurs, you can catch and handle it gracefully without crashing the entire program.
 TRY-The try block contains the code that you want to attempt to execute. 
 //If an error occurs within this block, it is thrown and execution immediately jumps to the corresponding catch block.
Catch-The catch block follows the try block and contains the code that handles the error thrown within the try block. 
 //If an error occurs, the control flow jumps to the catch block, and the error object is passed to the catch block as a parameter.

try {
  // Code that might throw an error
  throw new Error('Something went wrong');
} catch (error) {
  // Code to handle the error
  console.error('An error occurred:', error.message);
}

Compare -Error boundaries are specific to React and are used to handle errors in React component trees,
   // while try-catch blocks are a general JavaScript language feature used to handle errors in any JavaScript code.

Component Level vs. Code Block: Error boundaries are applied at the component level in React, 
    //whereas try-catch blocks are applied around specific blocks of code in JavaScript.

Fallback UI: Error boundaries in React can display a fallback UI when an error occurs, providing a better user experience,
// while try-catch blocks in JavaScript are primarily used for error handling and do not provide built-in mechanisms for displaying fallback UIs.
