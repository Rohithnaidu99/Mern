BoxModel-The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: content, padding, borders and margins.(CPBM)

Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent.

Note: margin is the space around an element's border, while padding is the space between the element's border and the element's content.
