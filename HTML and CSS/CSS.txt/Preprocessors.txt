CSS preprocessors are used to write styles in a special syntax that is then compiled into standard CSS. 
  //They extend the functionality of standard CSS by introducing features like variables, nesting, mixins, and functions.

Benefits of Using CSS Preprocessors:
Code Reusability: Preprocessors allow you to reuse code through mixins and functions, making stylesheets easier to maintain.
Enhanced Readability and Organization: Nesting allows you to write styles in a way that mirrors the structure of your HTML, which improves readability.
Easier Maintenance: Using variables for common values (e.g., colors, fonts) makes updating styles across a project simple.
Modular Code Structure: You can split your stylesheets into smaller files and import them into a main stylesheet, promoting a modular approach.

Popular CSS Preprocessors:
1.SASS -Sass is one of the most widely used CSS preprocessors.
     // It adds features such as variables, nesting, mixins, and functions, which help in writing clean and organized styles.
2.LESS-LESS is a backward-compatible language extension for CSS.
   // Features include variables, nesting, and mixins. It is developed to be similar to Sass but with a simpler syntax.
3.Stylus is a preprocessor that aims to be more flexible and feature-rich. 
    //Syntax is minimalistic and indentation-based. It also supports variables, nesting, and a wide range of functions.
4.SCSS is an extension of Sass that uses a CSS-like syntax.
   // It maintains compatibility with CSS syntax, making it easier for CSS developers to transition to SCSS.

Mixins in CSS  -
Mixins are a feature in CSS preprocessors (like Sass or LESS) that let you re-use groups of CSS rules throughout your stylesheets.
  Why Use Mixins?
Avoid code repetition
Make your code easier to maintain
Enable dynamic and flexible styling
