Major Features Introduced in CSS3:
1. CSS Transitions
   --Allows smooth changes of property values over time (e.g., hover effects).
2. CSS Animations
   --Enables complex animations directly in CSS without JavaScript.
3. Flexbox
A layout model that makes it easier to design complex layouts with simple rules.
4. CSS Grid
A powerful 2D layout system for creating complex grid-based designs.
5. Border Radius
Enables rounded corners with the border-radius property.
6. Web Fonts
With @font-face, you can load custom fonts for better typography.

CSS (Before CSS3):
Layouts were based on floats and positioning (absolute, relative, etc.).
Box model and clearfix were commonly used to solve layout issues.

CSS3:
Flexbox and CSS Grid make it much easier to create modern, responsive layouts without complex hacks.

CSS Grid allows for complex 2D layouts, while Flexbox is great for linear layouts.
